🧭 Distributed Tourism App - Hobby Project

Welcome to my hobby project! Motivated by a strong interest in distributed systems and microservice architecture, I decided to redesign an existing modular monolith tourism application (originally built with ASP.NET) into a set of independent microservices using Golang
🚀 Project Overview

    Original monolith application built with ASP.NET (modular architecture).
    Fully restructured into multiple microservices, each handling specific domain responsibilities.
    Introduced a Gateway service written in Golang, acting as the single entry point for the client application (Angular).
    Authentication logic has been extracted from the ASP.NET monolith and moved into a dedicated Auth service.
    All requests to protected routes are first validated by the Auth service before being forwarded to the target service.
    Every service has its own dedicated database, following the Database-per-service pattern.
    All services are fully Dockerized, using multi-stage builds and best Docker practices.

🧱 Tech Stack

    Golang – Gateway & new microservices
    ASP.NET – Legacy modules (initial version)
    Angular – Frontend (client)
    Docker – Containerization
    PostgreSQL/MongoDB – Per-service databases
    JWT – Authentication
    REST – Current communication protocol

🛠️ In Progress / Roadmap

    ✅ Microservice restructuring
    ✅ Authentication service
    ✅ Gateway integration
    ✅ NoSQL Databases
    ✅ Dockerization

Planned features:

    🔜 Implement Redis for caching frequently accessed resources.
    🔜 Add Monitoring and Logging mechanisms.
    🔜 Introduce a Follower service using Neo4j for user relationships (graph database).
    🔜 Switch from HTTP to gRPC communication between services for improved performance.

📦 Running the Project

    Full setup instructions and Docker Compose configuration coming soon.
